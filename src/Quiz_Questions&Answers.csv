Question Number,Question,Correct Answer,Incorrect Answer 1,Incorrect Answer 2,Incorrect Answer 3
1,Describe the relationship of the drawn graph,Directly Proportional,Proportional,Inversely Proportional,Indirectly Proportional
2,Click on the closest value to the gradient of the graph,4.9,3,6,9.8
3,"Therefore, what is the physical significance of the gradient?",1/2 Acceleration due to gravity,Acceleration due to gravity,Speed of the ball bearing,Gravitational Field Strength
4,What is the independent variable in this experiment?,Height between light gates,Speed of the ball,Time it takes for the ball to fall,Acceleration of the ball
5,What is the dependant variable in this experiment?,Time it takes for the ball to fall,Height between light gates,Acceleration of the ball,Speed of the ball
6,State a control variable,Same surface area of the ball,Time it takes for the ball to fall,Height between light gates,Acceleration of the ball
7,What is an advantage of using an automatic timer compared to a stopwatch?,More accurate results due to the elimation of human reaction time,More precise results due to the elimination of zero errors,Less likely to fail compared to a stopwatch,Less work needed to operate it
8,Which of the following do not influence the ball bearing's acceleration?,Mass,Air Resistance ,Both,Neither
9,Why is the pad used?,To prevent a trip accident if the ball falls onto the floor,To prevent it from falling on the floor,So the ball bearing doesn't bounce on impact,To quieten the impact of the ball
10,What is a disadvantage of using an electromagnet?,There could be a small delay between it becoming demagnetised and the ball dropping,The ball may not drop at all and still be attracted to the electromagnet,The electromagnet may not always switch off properly,Electromagnets are more expensive
11,What is the problem with using small heights?,Increases percentage uncertainty when measuring time,Ball bearing will not accelerate that much,Harder to measure smaller changes in time,Will give erroneous results for the value of g
12,Why must the distance between the first light gate and the ball be kept the same?,Reduces percentage uncertainty when measuring height,So that the ball enters the first light gate with the same speed,Easier to measure height ,Distance doesn’t actually matter
13,Why must the ball be dense?,To mitigate the effect of air resistance ,To ensure the ball falls in a straight line,So the ball falls faster,So the ball doesn’t bounce off the pad
